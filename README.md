# MultiPingSonar

Multi-Ping is a solution for obstacle detection in remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), utilizing altimeter echo sounders (Ping Sonar) from BlueRobotics. This system integrates four Ping altimeter sensors, each providing precise distance measurements and confidence levels, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the surroundings.

## Key Features

### Multi-Sensor Integration
- **Four Ping Altimeter Sensors**: These sensors work in unison to offer a multi-dimensional view of the underwater environment. Each sensor continuously sends out ultrasonic pulses and measures the time it takes for the echoes to return, calculating the distance to nearby objects.
- **Distance and Confidence Metrics**: Each sensor provides not only the distance to an obstacle but also a confidence level in the measurement's accuracy, enhancing the reliability of the data.

### Real-Time Data Processing
- **Full Data Transmission**: The application captures the entire data stream from the sensors, processing it in real-time to ensure no detail is missed. This comprehensive data handling allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of the underwater environment.
- **Accurate UI Display**: The processed data is presented on a user-friendly interface, designed to accurately reflect the real-time conditions detected by the sensors. This ensures that operators can make informed decisions based on the most current and precise information available.


## Applications
- **ROV Navigation**: The sensor system aids in navigating complex underwater environments, avoiding collisions with obstacles, and enhancing the safety and efficiency of underwater operations.
- **Surveying and Mapping**: By providing detailed and accurate distance measurements, the system is invaluable for underwater surveying and mapping tasks, ensuring precise data collection.
